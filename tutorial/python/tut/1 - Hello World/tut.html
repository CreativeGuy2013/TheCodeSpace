		<h1>An introduction</h1>
		<p>
			I'll start with the most classic example of code (ever): Hello, World!<br />
			I'll start by showing you the program and then I'll break it down and explain what does what.

		<h1>The explanation:</h1>

		<hr/>
		<hr/>

		<b>#!/usr/bin/python</b>
		<p>This is a bit hard to explain, but it basically tells the computer that it's a python program. For now, just ignore it.</p>

		<hr/>

		<b># Now for the actual program.</b>
		<p>This is a comment. Every line starting with a # will not be executed. Comments are very useful for explaining parts of the code. I'll be using these a lot in later tutorials, so pay attention to those.</p>

		<hr/>

		<b>greeting = 'Hello, World!'</b>
		<p>This line creates a variable. It says that when running the program it should interpret greeting (or whatever you want to call the variable) as its value. It's value in this example is a string (basically some text) saying Hello, World!</p>

		<hr/>

		<b>print(greeting)</b>
		<p>This tells the computer to say Hello, World! through a terminal or the IDE you use. To show you what'd happen I made an output block. Instead of print(greeting), you could also use print greeting. I prefer the first method because I used java and c based languages before python and thus am used to this method.</p>
